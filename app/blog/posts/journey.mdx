# My Journey in Tech, Sports, and Yoga  

From building scalable software solutions to practicing yoga and playing sports, my journey has been a mix of technology, movement, and mindfulness.  

## **Technology and Software Engineering**  
I’ve spent years working in the software development space, specializing in **Angular, .NET, and cloud technologies** like **Google Cloud and Terraform**. My experience spans **enterprise-level software development, cloud infrastructure design, and API security**, working on complex platform migrations and designing scalable, high-performance applications.  

At **Charles Schwab**, I played a key role in migrating the **Account Open and Onboarding platform**, ensuring a seamless transition to modern frameworks. My previous experience includes developing EMR systems, optimizing API gateways, and deploying cloud-based architectures.  

## **A Passion for Sports**  
Beyond the world of coding, I’ve always been passionate about sports. Whether it’s **soccer, cricket, or just about any game that keeps me active**, I find joy in movement and competition. Sports teach resilience, teamwork, and strategy—skills that surprisingly translate well into software engineering.  

## **Yoga**  
Balancing the fast-paced world of tech, I’ve found deep fulfillment in **yoga and meditation**, particularly through my involvement with the **Isha Foundation**. Practicing **yoga** has been transformative, offering not just physical benefits but also clarity and focus in both my professional and personal life. It’s a way to reconnect, stay grounded, and bring a sense of mindfulness into everything I do.  

## **The Intersection of It All**  
Technology, sports, and yoga may seem like distinct passions, but for me, they all come together in a way that keeps life balanced and fulfilling. Software engineering challenges my intellect, sports keep me physically engaged, and yoga brings a deeper sense of well-being.  

This is my journey—a blend of **code, movement, and mindfulness**.
